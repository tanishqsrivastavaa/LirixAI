# Introduction
 
Welcome to LirixAI! This is a Python library designed to simplify the development of agentic and multi-agentic systems by providing ready-to-use integrations with essential backend technologies.

## What is LirixAI?

LirixAI is an open-source, flexible, and powerful framework that streamlines the creation of agentic AI applications. It enables direct implementation of multi-agent systems by integrating tools such as web search APIs, database solutions like Supabase, and real-time communication protocols. Instead of manually setting up these services, developers can leverage LirixAI to accelerate their workflow with minimal effort.
## Why LirixAI?

Building agentic systems for backend applications is often tedious and repetitive, requiring extensive setup for:

    Memory management with databases (e.g., using embeddings in Supabase).
    Seamless web search integration for AI agents.
    Real-time multi-agent collaboration using tools like WebRTC.

LirixAI eliminates this complexity by providing pre-built, configurable components, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than setup.
